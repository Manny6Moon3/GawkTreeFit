Now the point of a famous Egyptian Prince pointing towards the magnanimous figure of The Pillar of Enoch (a.k.a. the Navel of the Earth) would be a definite clue as to why the ways and means of city building became an esoteric art so steeped in the heretofore mythology of these cloak and dagger clubs. Whose cathedral style alternated between Romanesque and Gothic. Why call these urban sprawls of the asphalt jungle 'The Bush' then? Why not call a pig skin tarpaulin cut into dimension for a lamp shade a form of failsafe by rote modern minimalist materials for corporate concept art too? This very coldly calculating and exceedingly Savoir Faire member of the Gentry had some sort of creeping suspicion that ALL THIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE.
