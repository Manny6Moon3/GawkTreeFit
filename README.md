This is a reminder for whichever traditionalist still thinks it's a safe bet to trust in passe ideas of fattening-up ceremonies, as the biggest
part of some jumped up pre-nuptial banal set-up. Where would-be 'wives are basically under house arrest to make them more antsy and commando-like
via boredom. And they're being fed the sort of so called 'cuisine' (otherwise known as HUSBAND-TO-GREASESPOT retardation potions that turn
the race of men into something bored stupid, egomaniacal and morose). This idea of allowing demure ones to turn into sex-crazed ant bully
neophytes, is a mere connivance akin to the proprietor of Thornfield--keeping a nutjob Caribbean wife under wraps. Whom he did not
know too well before the contract was forced down his throat. Anyone read Janus (two-faced) Airier than thou graceless Laissez Faire? The way the dad & bro of Lafayette lugubrious legumes treated him--totally reeks!!! So what have egg custard tarts got to do with anything?
