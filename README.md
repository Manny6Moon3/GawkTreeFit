This is a reminder for whichever traditionalist still thinks it's a safe bet to trust in passe ideas of fattening-up ceremonies, as 
part of some jumped up pre-nuptual aggregious set-up. Where would-be 'wives are basically under house arrest to make them more antsy
via boredom. And being fed the sort of so called 'cuisine' (otherwise known as HUSBAND-TO-GREASESPOT retardation potions that turn
the race of men into something routinary, egomaniacal and morose). This idea of allowing demure ones to turn into sex-crazed ant bully
neophytes, is a mere connivance akin to the proprietor of Thornfield--keeping a nutjob Carribean wife under wraps. Whom he did not
know too well before the contract was forced down his throat. Anyone read Janus Airy Laizzez Faire? The way the dad & bro of La 
Rochelle skimster... treated him--totally reeks!!! So what have egg custard tarts got to do with anything?
