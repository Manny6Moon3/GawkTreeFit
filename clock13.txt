This sort of humility suggests that he had read the book of Job really carefully, that he actually had appropriated the message, and gone on to apply 
that message in his own life. There are so few intellectuals that do that. Hegel had several followers who themselves became well known. But far away the
most famous is Karl Marx. Marx was born in Germany in 1818. And as a young student of Philosophy was very much a Hegelian. He didn't become a Socialist until 
his mid 20's, when he began to develop that rich and highly original mixture of German Philosophy, French Politics and British Economics which is Marxism. 
Together with a wealthy young industrialist, Friedrich Engels - he wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1848. The partnership between Marx and Engels must be 
just about the most momentous collaboration in the history of ideas. Engels kept Marx for most of his life, so that he could produce his writings. And it was 
a life spent largely in exile, because of Marx's political activities.
